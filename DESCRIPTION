Description: The WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN)'s mission is 
    to generate innovative tools and reliable evidence to inform the malaria 
    community on the factors affecting the efficacy of antimalarial medicines. 
    WWARN works with collaborators to optimise the efficacy of antimalarial 
    medicines and treatment regimens, especially for vulnerable groups including 
    pregnant women, infants and malnourished children, and provides evidence to 
    inform the development of new antimalarial drugs. WWARN also engages and 
    works with other disease research communities to replicate this model for 
    other tropical and neglected diseases. WWARN's interactive maps summarise
    data from published studies and data stored in the WWARN data centre.
