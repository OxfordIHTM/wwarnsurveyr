The [WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network
(WWARN)](https://www.wwarn.org)’s mission is to generate innovative
tools and reliable evidence to inform the malaria community on the
factors affecting the efficacy of antimalarial medicines.
[WWARN](https://www.wwarn.org) works with collaborators to optimise the
efficacy of antimalarial medicines and treatment regimens, especially
for vulnerable groups including pregnant women, infants and malnourished
children, and provides evidence to inform the development of new
antimalarial drugs. [WWARN](https://www.wwarn.org) also engages and
works with other disease research communities to replicate this model
for other tropical and neglected diseases.
[WWARN](https://www.wwarn.org)’s interactive maps summarise data from
published studies and data stored in the [WWARN](https://www.wwarn.org)
data centre.
