# wwarnsurveyr: WWARN Antimalarial Resistance Surveyors in R

<!-- badges: start -->

The WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN)’s mission is to
generate innovative tools and reliable evidence to inform the malaria
community on the factors affecting the efficacy of antimalarial
medicines. WWARN works with collaborators to optimise the efficacy of
antimalarial medicines and treatment regimens, especially for vulnerable
groups including pregnant women, infants and malnourished children, and
provides evidence to inform the development of new antimalarial drugs.
WWARN also engages and works with other disease research communities to
replicate this model for other tropical and neglected diseases. WWARN’s
interactive maps summarise data from published studies and data stored
in the WWARN data centre.
